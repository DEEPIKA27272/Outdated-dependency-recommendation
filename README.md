## Java API Comparator â€“ Breaking Change Analyzer

This project automates the comparison of two Java library versions to detect **breaking changes** using **JApiCmp**.


###  Components

#### 1. `Java_Api_Comparator.py`

This Python script is designed to:

* **Compare two versions** of a Java dependency (JAR files)
* Automatically execute **JApiCmp** (Java API Compatibility Checker)
* Generate **HTML reports** highlighting:

  * Modified classes/methods
  * Removed APIs
  * Breaking and non-breaking changes

#### 2. `JapiCmp/`

* This directory contains the **output reports** generated by `JApiCmp`
* Each HTML file is named and timestamped based on the comparison
* Reports can be opened in any browser and include detailed change logs


* Validate if upgrading a library will cause breaking changes
* Maintain backward compatibility in production systems
* Automate EOL dependency audits
